    <h3> Virus </h3>
    <div class="text_left">
        <p>
            An extremely dangerous virus is here.
            Ready to kill you.
            It names : "C6P-08"
            Discovered in 1896, it has already transforms millions of person
            into dangerous zombies.

    <h3> Story </h3>
    <div class="text_left">
        <p>
            The scenario is inspired by the pandemic suffered around 2019,
            it is a scenario extrapolated by us to imagine an
            apocalyptic scenario in which the spread of the virus would be more
            uncontrollable. Therefore, the idea of putting our characters in a
            hospital was much more consistent with the subject.
            The same goes for the resistance base at the Pentagon.
            The origin of the virus is extravagant enough to play on and create
            a crazy scenario. The choice to define zombies as an enemy seemed
            as an enemy seemed logical to us in view of the presence of a virus and
            a hospital.

    <h3> Origin </h3>
    <div class="text_left">
        <p>
            The map is inspired by the look of the Mob of the Dead
            in Call Of Duty Black Ops 2. In the sense that our players
            will be in a hospital and not a prison and will be in a
            building with no access to the outside. The puzzles in our game are
            related to the "Easter Eggs" secrets, allowing
            to give a goal to our game other than surviving as long as possible.
            The idea of implementing a game master and optional quests comes from escape games,
            in which a voice tells us the different quests and paths to take
            in order to win the game.

    <h3> Gameplay </h3>
    <div class="text_left">
        <p>
            The choice of adding characteristics to each of our
            seemed to us to be a good way to diversify
            the games. However, we wanted to keep the fairness between the
            characters, which is why we chose to keep the same base for each of them
            base for each of them, whether it is their equipment or their
            damage. Therefore, each person will be important in his own way,
            so we will have to ask our teammate with better attributes
            in order to help us in some quest. The goal is really
            to exploit the advantages of each one in our games.
