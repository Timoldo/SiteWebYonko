    <p>Description: Always present to help others, I know how to stand out in areas where I am good. Creating a project with such a big challenge is a battle for me. Since I was young, I have been playing games, and creating my own would be incredible. I will do my best to achieve a clean and playable final version. I believe we make a good team, and I know we will succeed.</p>

    <p>Description: Part-time gamer. Hardworking and never gives up. Having had different approaches to computer science, I became interested in root-me a few years ago, which made me want to pursue this field. It's a pleasure to be able to work on this project, it's a real challenge that I have never encountered before. The discovery can only be interesting!</p>

    <p>Description: I have been playing video games since I was a child. I started getting interested in the field of computer science in high school, and I immediately fell in love with coding. The problem-solving and logical aspects of programming appealed to me. So, I am excited to work hard on this project that is dear to me. It will be a completely new experience for me, as I have never worked on a computer science project in a group before.
      I am very eager to see the final outcome of our project.</p>

    <p>Description: I have some difficulties in physics and English, but other than that, I'm not doing so bad... I love projects, algorithms, and everything related to computer science. I occasionally play a zombie mode. The project looks really interesting, and I think I will learn a lot, both practical knowledge in C# and Unity, and also how to work in a group. My last group project was in NSI last year, but it was not as well-organized. Moreover, the group for this project is really pleasant; we are all on the same wavelength, and everyone is motivated and hardworking. However, I wonder how much time this project will take and what difficulties we will encounter. Can't wait to find out!</p>
